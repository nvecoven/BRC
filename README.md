## Pytorch implementation and binary addition task
A great [implementation of the NBRC and BRC cells has been made in Pytorch](https://github.com/niklexical/brc_pytorch) thanks to [Nikita Janakarajan](https://github.com/niklexical) and [Jannis Born
](https://github.com/jannisborn). They also test the NBRC and BRC cells on binary addition tasks, on which they exhibit great performances.

## Dependencies
The only dependency for the code provided is tensorflow 2 (and numpy, which is installed by default with tensorflow).

Install tensorflow : https://www.tensorflow.org/install

Nengolib is also required for the LMU cells.

## Run experiments
Each benchmark included in the paper can be runned through the launcher script.
